You are given a positive integer n, you can do the following operation any number of times:

Add or subtract a power of 2 from n.
Return the minimum number of operations to make n equal to 0.

A number x is power of 2 if x == 2i where i >= 0.

 

Example 1:

Input: n = 39
Output: 3
Explanation: We can do the following operations:
- Add 20 = 1 to n, so now n = 40.
- Subtract 23 = 8 from n, so now n = 32.
- Subtract 25 = 32 from n, so now n = 0.
It can be shown that 3 is the minimum number of operations we need to make n equal to 0.
Example 2:

Input: n = 54
Output: 3
Explanation: We can do the following operations:
- Add 21 = 2 to n, so now n = 56.
- Add 23 = 8 to n, so now n = 64.
- Subtract 26 = 64 from n, so now n = 0.
So the minimum number of operations is 3.
 

Constraints:

1 <= n <= 105

```
/**
 * @param {number} n
 * @return {number}
 */
var minOperations = function(n) {
    const binary = [...n.toString(2)].reverse();
    
    let carry = 0
    let count = 0;
    for (let i = 0; i < binary.length; i++) {
        const curr = binary[i];
        // const next = binary[i + 1];
        if (curr === '1') {
            carry += 1;
            continue;
        }

        if (carry === 0) continue;
        
        if (carry === 1) {
            count += 1;
            carry = 0;
            continue;
        }
        
        count += 1;
        carry = 1;
    }

    if (carry > 0) count++;
    if (carry > 1) count++;
    
    return count;
};
```
